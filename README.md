## Background

I chose to make this project because of my prior knowledge of Chatbots from seeing
them on the internet and having worked with them a bit during the first semester of my
AP Computer Science Principles class last year in the fall of 2020.

## Install

I expect to use the Repl install system to run my Chatbot application.

## Usage

To use my Chatbot application, you simply need to click run, which makes the bot say
the message, "Hi, how's it going?", and then prompt the user to type a reply below, which will then cause one of six random responses from the bot. This cycle of replies can continue for as long as the user wishes to use the Chatbot.
